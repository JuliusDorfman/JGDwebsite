<span className="blog-lead-big neon-red">> Why are things changing so dang much?</span>
</div> 

<span className="blog-lead-big"><span className="support-team">Product Support</span></span>, by its nature, is a <span className="neon-white">reactive profession</span>.

The needs of users dictate the <span className="support-team">Support Team</span>'s work on a daily, weekly, and as we're now experiencing for the first time in SaaS history, generational basis. The last shift this significant was the rise of self-service in the late '90s, when <span className="neon-white">Microsoft</span> couldn't outscale their incoming support requests. So they did then what is common practice now: <span className="blog-highlight">customer self-enablement</span>; publish the FAQ and DOCs for customers to help themselves, shifting <span className="support-team">Support</span>'s responsibility from, <span className="blog-dim">answer every user question</span>, to, <span className="neon-white">answer every question the users can't answer themselves</span>. Sound familiar? <span className="neon-cyan">AI is doing it again.</span>

The difference is that, according to Gartner, by 2029 <span className="blog-dim">(an extremely conservative estimate)</span>, [agentic AI will resolve <span className="blog-stat underline">80%</span> of incoming customer queries](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-05-gartner-predicts-agentic-ai-will-autonomously-resolve-80-percent-of-common-customer-service-issues-without-human-intervention-by-20290) without requiring any human bandwidth at all.

So if your product AI handles a majority of tickets now...

<div className="blog-pull-quote">

<span className="neon-red">> What's left for the humans?</span>

</div>

The embedded AI assistant in your SaaS product is servicing a new generation of technically-inclined users who instinctively self-troubleshoot. Ergo, nobody is reaching out for a <span className="blog-dim">post-sale product walkthrough</span>, <span className="blog-dim">UI navigation issue</span>, or <span className="blog-dim">"how do I..."</span>. Touch and go interactions are extinct. Yes, your ticket queue has not only gotten very short, but the <span className="neon-white">substance is more demanding, the resolutions are more complex, and your customer/<span className="support-team">support team</span> touchpoints are more numerous</span>. 

So that brings us to... 

<div className="blog-pull-quote">


<span className="blog-lead-big neon-cyan">> Why We Still Need People In Support</span>

</div> 

<span className="blog-section-label" style={{color: '#ff4141'}}>Pillar one</span>

## Perceived Accountability

When an AI assistant tells your client <span className="blog-dim">"we understand how important this is to you"</span>... who is "We"? The company dev who plugged in your API Key authorizing the <span className="blog-dim">$0.00015–$0.0003 charge per 1,000 tokens</span> resulting in a "We Care" pattern-matched statement? <span className="neon-white">Nobody is accountable for that promise.</span> 

<span className="neon-cyan">It takes <span className="neon-purple">a Being</span> capable of the Conscious Human Experience to take accountability.</span>
You cannot simulate the conscious human experience and so, neither can you simulate accountability. Legislatively, <span className="neon-white">AI accountability is following the same logic as animal ownership</span>. In 2024, Canadian courts held [Air Canada liable](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-february/bc-tribunal-confirms-companies-remain-liable-information-provided-ai-chatbot/) after its AI chatbot promised to honor a non-existent refund policy.

The subtext here is that you cannot Punish an AI in any meaningful way, or at least in any meaningful way to the <span className="neon-cyan">Conscious Human Experience.</span>

On a Macro Level, the company needs a human being who failed in their duties to be able to be held accountable. On a micro level, the customer needs to be able to <span className="neon-purple">feel</span> that their issue is being understood and that there will be consequences satisfying to the <span className="neon-cyan">Conscious Human Experience</span> if not resolved.

## Throughput vs Situational Awareness

Your AI Assistant can process more tickets than a team of a 1,000 Human Support Agents. It can also organize them by priority and urgency. It can also roadmap and triage these issues to the right teams and write documentation along the way. 

<div><span className="neon-red">But...</span></div>

<div><span className="blog-lead-small neon-cyan">Support is still, and will always be about, Customer Service.</span></div>
<br />

I'll leave it up to you to think about all the ways you've had food delivered to your table.

Your AI Agent hasn't been to your most recent weekly stand-up. It also doesn't know which Product Engineer is the backup SME on the new feature that just soft-launched to a handful of your Enterprise SLA clients comprising 80% of your MRR, or what tone is appropriate in a new communication with the customer's developer in charge of product integration before a critical release.

There's a difference between <span className="neon-cyan">a positive, satisfying experience achieved while taking steps to avoid the interstitial friction of cross-team and cross-company collaboration</span>... VS... <span className="blog-dim">we've roped in the appropriate individuals; task complete -> initiating next unavoidable collaboration event.</span> 

Though... in another universe...

## Human Growth and Want

A human <span className="support-team">Support agent</span> is a collector of <span className="neon-cyan">peripheral data</span>. Remember those junior developer jobs that have disappeared? Well, those humans are on your <span className="support-team">Support Team</span> now (always have been). They're <span className="neon-cyan">trend noticers</span> and <span className="neon-cyan">roadmap projectors</span>; these are your next Product Engineers and Product Managers whose context windows don't truncate and whose sessions have no token limit.

The <span className="neon-cyan">context</span> that doesn't explicitly pass through a matrix of keywords and patterns is the context that may not be optimal for ticket resolution, but it is the kind that leads to <span className="neon-cyan">innovation</span>. An AI Agent will never have experienced the <span className="neon-purple">want</span> needing a solution and then experiencing the friction in achieving that solution. No friction -> nothing to <span className="neon-purple">want</span> to change -> no innovation.

<div className="blog-callout">

Consider: no AI would have suggested removing the <span className="neon-white">"Save" button</span> and replacing it with incremental autosave and change history; now an industry standard across <span className="blog-dim">Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Builder.io</span>. In fact, it may not be optimal for everyone. I've received a few tickets asking, "where did my save button go". Until the AI can juggle philosophies like utilitarianism and deontology and apply that lens to a save button while taking into account what your best friend thinks, innovation is for the guy or gal who spent 2 years in product support.

<span className="blog-section-label" style={{color: '#e8e8e8'}}>So what now?</span>

## The Bar Isn't Lower, It's Different


AI Assistants didn't replace your <span className="support-team">Support Team</span>. It freed up your team's <span className="neon-purple">bandwidth</span>.

<span className="neon-red">So what's left?</span> 
<span className="neon-cyan">Empathy</span>, <span className="neon-cyan">relationships</span>, and <span className="neon-purple">want</span>. These are the non-simulateable, and non-optimizable, and non-automatable aspects of the <span className="neon-cyan">The Human Conscious Experience</span> that make humans capable of holding the <span className="neon-cyan">accountability</span> that build mutual trust between your company and your customers. <span className="blog-dim">And Raise NPS Scores.&#128578;</span>



<div className="blog-neon-rule" />

<div className="blog-pull-quote">

AI is a tool for optimizing ticket resolution. The humans on the <span className="support-team">Support Team</span>'s job is to wield that tool and optimize for the <span className="neon-cyan">The Human Conscious Experience</span> of your customers.
